  <!-- Note to whoever is looking: I was thinking we could have up just the current semester pop up in this section and after that create an
	archve page. The archive page will hold the events from a single semester that way each page won't get too big. We can link to a page
  from this one that will have links to the individual semesters and their articles -->
